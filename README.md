- Clone Google Research's repository (second code block in Honors Thesis.py)

- Overwrite Google's documents with these four provided files:
  bit_ao.py
  config.py
  train.py
  util_fns.py

**Settings for ai training may be changed in util_fns.py**

**Folder architecture may be required for the codebase to operate functionally**
